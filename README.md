# Vim Trainer :keyboard:

They say that _repetition leads to dominance_ and, for that purpose, this application allows you to learn and exercise commands from different levels of our dear friend Vim (Vi, or whatever you use).

In beginner mode, there are 7 levels of commands.

The expert mode has not yet been implemented, but the beginner mode is good for practicing commands, even if you already know.

## Installing Dependencies

For execution it is necessary to install some dependencies that are in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/RuanGOA/vim-trainer/blob/main/requirements.txt) file. To make it easier, you can run [setup.sh](https://github.com/RuanGOA/vim-trainer/blob/main/setup.sh).

> sh setup.sh

## Execution

After installing the dependencies, running Vim Trainer is very simple, just run the main.py file with python 3 and hands on.

> python3 main.py
