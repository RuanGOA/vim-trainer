# Vim Trainer :chart_with_upwards_trend:

They say that _repetition leads to dominance_ and, for that purpose, this application allows you to learn and exercise commands from different levels of our dear friend Vim (Vi, or whatever you use).

There are 10 levels of commands, with 40 lessons chosen at random in each one.

## Installing Dependencies

For execution it is necessary to install some dependencies that are in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/RuanGOA/vim-trainer/blob/main/requirements.txt) file. To make it easier, you can run [setup.sh](https://github.com/RuanGOA/vim-trainer/blob/main/setup.sh).

> sh setup.sh
